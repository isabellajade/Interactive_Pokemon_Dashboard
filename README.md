# Pokemon Project 3
For this project we used JavaScript in combination with HTML/CSS, a Python Flask-powered API, and a MongoDB database to create a Pokemon inspired dashboard with multiple interactive charts that update from the same data. The charts on our dashboard were created with the use of Plotly and eCharts. The data was pulled using D3. 

## Dashboard
Run the [app.py](https://github.com/isabellajade/Project3_Pokemon/blob/main/app.py) file to open the Flask API

Then open the [index.html](https://github.com/isabellajade/Project3_Pokemon/blob/main/index.html) file to view the Pokemon dashboard


# Interactive Charts
When selecting a Pokemon name from the dropdown menu, the first four charts on the dashboard will change using the data associated with the selected pokemon. 

## Pokemon Dropdown Menu
This is the dropdown menu that controls the first four charts on the dashboard. In this example we will be selecting Bulbasaur, and it will change the following charts with this Pokemon's data.

## Pokemon Type Display Box
This box displays the selected Pokemon's type(s).

## Glamour Shot

## Pokemon Stats
Displayed here is a bar chart of the selected Pokemon's stats. This includes their HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.

## Height Comparison
This chart, visualized with eCharts, compares the height of the selected Pokemon with the height of the average human, represented with a picture of popular Pokemon trainer Ash Kechum.

# Static Charts
These charts on that dashboard don't change when the dropdown menu is selected. Instead, they give us valuable information regarding the distribution of all of the Pokemon's stats and types.

## Pokemon Types
Each Pokemon can be up to two element types. To represent the distribution of pokemon types across 800+ different Pokemon, we visualized that into a bubble chart. 

![Bubble Chart]()

The bigger the size of the bubble, the more pokemon there are with that combination of type(s). 

## Attack and Defense Distribution
The scatter plot compares all pokemon's defense (x-axis) and attack (y-axis) stats. The color scale of the point on the chart represents the pokemon's HP.
